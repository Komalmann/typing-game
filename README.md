# Typing Game

A typing game built with HTML, CSS & Vanilla JavaScript to help  increase the typing speed. After the user clicks the start button, quote his displayed for him/her to type. At the end, the total time taken for typing is calculated and displayed.

Also built as a part of my JavaScript learning process. Helped me understand the concept of event driven programming in JavaScript & other important functions.
